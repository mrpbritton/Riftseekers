  lore: "Trouble is brewing on board, rumors are going around that our tear drive
    is dead and that we are just floating out in space. It\u2019s total crap if there
    was an emergency the security staff would have known by now. On top of that we
    have some of the best mechanics in the system on board. Surely they would be
    able to fix the ship if it were to malfunction right\u2026 The more I think about
    it the more unsure I am. I think I just need to listen to Lydia again and lie
    down. All this stress is making my head hurt."
