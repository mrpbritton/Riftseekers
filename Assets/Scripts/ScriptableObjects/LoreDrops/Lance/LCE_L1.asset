  lore: "My name is Private Lance Vastra and I serve on the security force for block
    B of the Riftwalker. This is my first security voyage and it\u2019s already sucking
    the life out of me. Day in and day out I stand watching the same damn hallway.
    I would rather be doing anything else, nothing interesting ever happens here.
    I have a girl back home Lydia, she\u2019s the only thing that keeps me going.
    There\u2019s no outside communication here so all I have is a little recorded
    message she made for me before I left and I listen to it every night before I
    go to bed."
