  lore: "There is no hope. Today a kid made a run for our supply room and\u2026 and
    I shot him. Without a second thought either, just following protocol is what
    I told myself. In reality I know it\u2019s because I need that food to live.
    All this tension, all these issues hoping that our distress signals would be
    heard. No one is coming for us. We will not be saved. Now I have blood on my
    hands and it\u2019s tearing me apart. I keep listening to her voice but it doesn\u2019t
    help. I sit listening over and over again to the husk of someone I used to love
    as if that\u2019s going to keep my humanity intact."
