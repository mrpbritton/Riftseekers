  lore: "This is the end. Today the people mutinied against us. They\u2019re all
    dead now. They just kept coming. Charging straight into our line just waiting
    to be cut down. That hall is stained with the crimson remains of an entire generation.
    All of it by my hand. Whatever good part of me I had left is dead. I deserve
    a fate worse than death. How did it come to this? How did a simple security voyage
    turn me into a butcher. I\u2019m taking my fate into my own hands, giving myself
    the last bit of justice I deserve. I let the monster inside of me out, and it\u2019s
    time to put it back in its cage."
