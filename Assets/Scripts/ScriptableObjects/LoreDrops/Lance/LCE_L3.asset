  lore: "Well I guess I was wrong. We\u2019re screwed, command just let us know that
    the rumors are true today. They\u2019ve sent out distress signals but they wouldn\u2019t
    tell us if any of them came back. \u201CStay busy\u201D they said, trying to
    keep our minds off it as if the looming doom of the entire ship is something
    I can just forget about for an evening. On top of that it\u2019s getting worse,
    the passengers are convinced now and things are getting restless. More fights
    have been breaking out and people are begging us for help. Little do they know
    there\u2019s nothing any of us can do but wait at this point. Lydia\u2019s voice
    brings me no comfort anymore. It's just the same droning melody now, I can\u2019t
    even remember her face, my only motivation is slowly slipping away from me."
