  lore: "It\u2019s beautiful, the void, great beyond, or whatever you want to call
    it. I saw everything. Every event in human history all at once, seemingly in
    the blink of an eye. In a way, it almost made me seem insignificant. Just a speck
    of dust on the canvas of history if even that. I don\u2019t remember coming out
    of there, I just woke up on the floor of the lab and the power seems to be out.
    What a ride. To think, all of our history as a species is simply a murmur in
    this higher plane."
