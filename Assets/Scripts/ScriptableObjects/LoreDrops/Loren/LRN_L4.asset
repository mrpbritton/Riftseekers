  lore: "Success! I was able to generate a localized tear in the lab. I only kept
    it on for a few minutes just to test the possibility of this. I want to go inside.
    I want to find out what\u2019s beyond the veil of this mysterious realm we traverse
    through every day. Despite the amount of time I have spent researching this technology
    I have found shockingly few descriptions and details of this space and I aim
    to be a pioneer of this new frontier I have found. Just one step further, I\u2019m
    so close to discovering something big! This would put me on the map and I would
    finally be recognized for the scientist I am. I\u2019m going in tomorrow, I need
    to see this all first hand."
