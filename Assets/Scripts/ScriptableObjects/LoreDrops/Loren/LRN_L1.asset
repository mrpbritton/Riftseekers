  lore: "I can\u2019t believe this! I finally have access to an actual real tear
    drive. I\u2019ve been researching this technology for years and now I finally
    get to have it in my hands to experiment on. Engineering had to replace the old
    tear drive in the Riftwalker and so they have given me the old one to repair
    and experiment with. I can\u2019t wait to get started!"
