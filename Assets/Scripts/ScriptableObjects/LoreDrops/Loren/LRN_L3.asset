  lore: "I\u2019ve hit a snag. Despite the miniscule size of the tear I am trying
    to create, the drive doesn\u2019t have a sufficient power supply for the task
    here in the lab. I will have to procure a solution. I hear the maintenance wing
    has a surplus of spare batteries for the various facilities and automata on the
    ship. Maybe I can start there\u2026"
