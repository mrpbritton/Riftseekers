  lore: "This tear drive has been absolutely fascinating to work with! The way the
    drive quickly spins up to a ready state is quite impressive considering this
    model\u2019s age. I have a theory that with some tweaking I can open a small
    tear within the confines of the lab and get a better look at the space that these
    ships travel through. We all use this technology on a daily basis and I need
    to understand it before I can research other uses for it."
