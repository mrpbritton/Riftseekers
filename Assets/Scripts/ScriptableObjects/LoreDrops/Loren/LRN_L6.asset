  lore: "It\u2019s worse than I could\u2019ve imagined. When I came back something
    must have gone wrong. The ship\u2019s main tear drive is no longer working. I
    suspect the tuning ring was thrown all out of sort due to the closing of the
    tear I created in the lab. Hopefully our distress signal reaches help in time
    or else we\u2019re screwed. How did I let this happen? From my initial testing
    I knew these tears caused weird irregularities in real space. I let my hubris
    blind me, the thought that I was special. I\u2019ve damned us all and I have
    no one to blame but myself. "
